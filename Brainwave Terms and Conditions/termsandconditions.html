            This is a demo text. A Terms and Conditions agreement acts as a
            legal contract between you (the company) and the user. It's where
            you maintain your rights to exclude users from your app in the event
            that they abuse your website/app, set out the rules for using your
            service and note other important details and disclaimers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a Terms and Conditions agreement is completely optional. No
            laws require you to have one. Not even the super-strict and
            wide-reaching General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Terms and Conditions agreement will be uniquely yours. While
            some clauses are standard and commonly seen in pretty much every
            Terms and Conditions agreement, it's up to you to set the rules and
            guidelines that the user must agree to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Terms and Conditions agreements are also known as Terms of Service
            or Terms of Use agreements.<br>
            These terms are interchangeable, practically speaking.<br>
            A Terms and Conditions is not required and it's not mandatory by
            law.
